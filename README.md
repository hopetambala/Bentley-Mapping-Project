## Description
The goal of this project is to use mapping technologies such as Leaflet to understand African American residence populations from 1853 to 1973. Through the use 

The data was queried into a Pandas to allow for easier data manipulation. CSVs of the data were generated and placed into the Aframe folder. Using python to clean and manipuate the data we received, we present markers using Crossfilter/D3 to represent markers that demonstrate the residences over time. 

## Libraries
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
