        "Text": "One of the first residential areas, the Fourth Ward was quickly known as the center of Ann Arbor. Over time, the demographics changed from the leading class to those receiving fewest resources. Newer districts had more growth so authorities often left the Fourth Ward out of developing infrastructure. A product of this was the closing of the de facto segregated Jones Elementary. Today, a plan to construct a hotel in the historic district provokes tension.",

In 1949, Virginia Ellis, School of Music masters student, performed with fellow Dunbar Center musicians in the auditorium. Eventually, the school relocated and the building was bought by the university for dormitories.",
